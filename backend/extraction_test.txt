15. Looking at this text, I can see it contains experimental results, figures, and data tables related to a study on language models and Harry Potter text familiarity. However, this appears to be content from within a research paper rather than a bibliography section. There are no numbered reference markers like [1], [2], etc., and no bibliographic entries with author names, titles, publication venues, years, or DOIs/URLs that would constitute a reference list
